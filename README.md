<h1>"Quiz Game"</h1>

<hr>
<h2>Project Description:</h2>
A timed quiz made with JavaScript to demonstrate JS fundamentals.

The game begins with a start screen explaining the rules. The game starts, by clicking the "Play Game" button, which starts the countdown timer and displays the first questions with 4 multiple choice answers. When an answer is selected, text verifying whether the answer was correct or incorrect, and either the score is increased or the time decreased accordingly. When time runs out or all questions are answered, the screen displays "Game Over," the final score, and requests the user's initials. Once initials are entered, the "High Score" rankings are displayed with buttons to either clear the rankings or play again.
